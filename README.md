# Curiously recurring template pattern
This is a pattern in C++ where a base class has its derived class as
a template parameter. See [example.cpp](./example.cpp).

I wondered whether something similar would work in Go. Sure enough, it works!
This repo shows an example. See [example.go](./example.go).
